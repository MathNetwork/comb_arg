# `DLTCover` — the richer cover output of the DLT-style construction

The Stage A + B output of the DLT §3.2 Step 1 construction, packaged
as a first-class structure that exposes the spacing / refinement
data the abstract `FiniteCoverWithWitnesses` collapses into a plain
multiplicity bound. Geometric consumers (DLT modified-sweepout
blending, which requires positive-measure overlap on
`J_i ∩ J_{i+1}`) consume this type; pure scalar consumers can
downgrade via `DLTCover.toFinite`.

## Contents

* `DLTCover` — the structure: an `InitialCover` + a terminal
  `PartialRefinement` + `σ`-injectivity + the Stage-B termination
  invariant `∀ i, ic.I i ⊆ ⋃ k, pr.J k`.
* Convenience projections: `J`, `σ`, `wit`.
* `saving_on_J` — `f − E_{σ(k)} ≥ 1/(4N)` on the open piece `J k`.
* `saving_bound_closure` — same bound on `closure (J k)`, via
  continuity (`ge_of_closure_of_ge`).
* `twoFold_closure` — at most two pieces' closures contain any `t`,
  via `SkippedSpacedIntervals.not_three_overlap_any_order` plus
  `σ`-injectivity.
* `covers_nearCritical` — the open pieces `J k` cover the
  near-critical set.
* `toFinite` — downgrade to `FiniteCoverWithWitnesses` by taking
  closures of pieces and attaching uniform saving `1/(4N)`.

## Design rationale

See `paper/sections/intro.tex` Remark 1.5 (`rem:why-construction`)
and `docs/design-notes.md`. The abstract `FiniteCoverWithWitnesses`
suffices for the scalar Theorem 1.3 / sup-reduction Corollary 1.5
(see `CombArg.Scalar.Partition` for an alternative scalar proof
via partition-by-endpoints), but discards the positive-measure
overlap structure that DLT's modified-sweepout blending requires.
This file preserves that structure for forward compatibility with
GMT consumers under `CombArg.Geometric.*`.

/-! ## Structure -/

/-- **DLT-style cover output.** Produced by `exists_DLTCover` in
`CombArg/OneDim/Assembly.lean`. Packages the Stage A + B intermediate
state (initial cover + terminal partial refinement + σ-injectivity +
termination invariant) so that downstream geometric consumers can
access the spacing / overlap / witness-assignment structure directly.

/-! ## Convenience projections -/

/-- The `k`-th piece `J_k` of the refinement, as a subset of
`unitInterval`. Open in Case 1, open-minus-open (open) in Case 2. -/
@[reducible] def J (k : Fin D.L) : Set unitInterval := D.refinement.J k

/-- Witness-index assignment: the `k`-th refined piece is associated
with the `σ k`-th initial-cover interval (and the `σ k`-th witness). -/
@[reducible] def σ (k : Fin D.L) : Fin D.initialCover.n := D.refinement.σ k

/-- The `LocalWitness` attached to the `k`-th refined piece, namely
the `σ k`-th witness of the underlying `InitialCover`. -/
@[reducible] def wit (k : Fin D.L) :
    LocalWitness unitInterval f
      (D.initialCover.witnessCenter (D.σ k)) (1 / (4 * (N : ℝ))) :=
  D.initialCover.wit (D.σ k)

/-! ## Saving bound on the open piece and its closure -/

/-- The saving bound on the open piece `J k`, via the witness's
`saving_bound` lifted through `J_subset` and `I_subset_neighborhood`. -/
lemma saving_on_J (k : Fin D.L) (t : unitInterval) (ht : t ∈ D.J k) :
    f t - (D.wit k).replacementEnergy t ≥ 1 / (4 * (N : ℝ)) :=
  (D.wit k).saving_bound t
    (D.initialCover.I_subset_neighborhood (D.σ k)
      (D.refinement.J_subset k ht))

/-- **Saving-bound extends to closure via continuity.** For
`t ∈ closure (D.J k)`, the inequality
`f t − (D.wit k).replacementEnergy t ≥ 1/(4N)` holds, lifted from
the open piece via `LocalWitness.replacementEnergy_continuous`
plus continuity of `f` --- the set `{s | 1/(4N) ≤ f s − E s}` is
closed and contains the open piece, hence contains its closure. -/
lemma saving_bound_closure (hf : Continuous f)
    (k : Fin D.L) (t : unitInterval) (ht : t ∈ closure (D.J k)) :
    f t - (D.wit k).replacementEnergy t ≥ 1 / (4 * (N : ℝ)) :=

    (fun s hs => D.saving_on_J k s hs) ht

/-! ## TwoFold closure overlap (parity rescue) -/

/-- **TwoFold for the closure pieces**: every `t ∈ unitInterval` lies
in `closure (D.J k)` for at most two indices `k`. Combines
`σ`-injectivity with the parity-rescue lemma
`SkippedSpacedIntervals.not_three_overlap_any_order` on the
underlying spaced-intervals geometry. -/

/-! ## Coverage of the near-critical set -/

/-- The open refined pieces `{J k}` cover the near-critical set. -/

    nearCritical f m₀ N ⊆ ⋃ k : Fin D.L, D.J k := by

/-! ## Downgrade to `FiniteCoverWithWitnesses` -/

/-- **Downgrade to the abstract scalar interface.** Take closures of
the open refined pieces, attach uniform saving `1/(4N)`, and use the
`σ k`-th witness's `replacementEnergy`. The two-fold bound, saving
bound, and coverage all transfer from the corresponding lemmas above.

This is the conversion used by `CombArg.OneDim.exists_refinement`:
the abstract scalar API is the composition `exists_DLTCover ∘ toFinite`.
The `hN : 0 < N` hypothesis is needed only for `saving_pos`. -/
