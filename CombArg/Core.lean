# Core — abstract sup reduction from a finite cover with witnesses

Given a continuous energy `f : K → ℝ` on a compact nonempty space `K`
with supremum `m₀`, suppose we have a **finite cover of the
`δ`-near-critical set** `{t | f t ≥ m₀ − δ}` with per-piece savings
at least `ε > 0` (`ε ≤ δ`) and multiplicity at most 2. Then a
competitor `f' : K → ℝ` exists with `sSup (range f') ≤ m₀ − ε`.

This file isolates the **arithmetic core** of the combinatorial
lemma, stripped of any parameter-space specifics (`unitInterval`, 1D
covering, `LocalWitness`, `PairableCover`). Consumers with an
application-specific cover construction feed it in; this file handles
the scalar arithmetic uniformly in `(δ, ε)`.

See `CombArg/SupReduction.lean` for the 1D application (`K = [0,1]`,
`δ = 1/N`, `ε = 1/(4N)`) that composes the 1D cover construction
(`CombArg/Refinement/`) with this core.

/-- **Scalar sup reduction lemma** — the pure-arithmetic core.

If `g : K → ℝ` is pointwise dominated by `f` and saves at least
`ε` on the super-level set `{f ≥ m₀ − δ}`, and `ε ≤ δ`, then
`sSup (range g) ≤ m₀ − ε`. No topology, no compactness, no cover:
the content is the single case split on whether `t` belongs to
the super-level set.

This lemma is independent of the combinatorial-argument
structure; it packages the single arithmetic fact that the rest
of `CombArg.Core` composes with the cover-and-witness data. -/

/-- **Finite cover with witnesses.**

The abstract input to the core theorem: a finite index type `ι` of
pieces `{piece l ⊆ K}` covering the `δ`-near-critical set
`{t | f t ≥ m₀ − δ}`, with per-piece replacement-energy functions,
per-piece savings bounded below by `ε`, and multiplicity ≤ 2.

Parameterized by the near-critical threshold `δ` and the per-piece
saving floor `ε`. For the 1D application (`CombArg/Refinement/`),
`δ = 1/N` and `ε = 1/(4N)`.

The multiplicity bound is currently hardcoded to `2`, matching the
DLT parity-rescue construction. It is recorded as a structural
invariant but is **not arithmetically load-bearing** for the output
`m₀ − ε`: the pointwise bound uses only `saving_ge_eps` and
`saving_pos`. -/

/-- **The reduced energy** — DLT §3.2 scalar version.

At each `t : K`, subtract from `f t` the total saving contribution
over all pieces containing `t`:

    f' t  =  f t  −  ∑ { C.saving l | l ∈ C.piecesContaining t }.

* If `t` lies in no piece: sum is empty, `f' t = f t`.
* If `t` lies in at least one piece: each summand is `≥ ε` by
  `saving_ge_eps`, the rest are non-negative by `saving_pos`, so the
  total subtraction is `≥ ε`.

The explicit sum makes the multiplicity contribution transparent.
The two-fold bound `C.twoFold` prevents unbounded over-subtraction
but is not needed for the current output bound. -/

/-- **Core theorem** — abstract sup reduction from a finite cover
with witnesses.

Let `K` be a compact nonempty space, `f : K → ℝ` continuous with
`m₀ = sSup (range f)`, and fix `0 < ε ≤ δ`. From a
`FiniteCoverWithWitnesses K f m₀ δ ε` (a finite multiplicity-bounded
cover of the `δ`-near-critical set with per-piece savings ≥ ε), a
competitor `f' : K → ℝ` exists with `sSup (range f') ≤ m₀ − ε`.

The output `f' = C.reducedEnergy` is the DLT-style pointwise
subtraction of all applicable savings from `f`. -/
